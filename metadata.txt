description=Export vector layers to a d3.js map, with optional popup information, charts and legend
about=A python QGIS plugin to export polygons, polylines and point vector layers from shapefiles to topojson for display within a web page using the d3.js JavaScript library, with additional options of popup information based on d3-tip, charts from c3.js and a legend. The aim of the plugin is not to replicate all of the mapping functionality available within d3, nor is it to provide every type of chart or data visualisation. The plugin aims to provide you with the a solid starting point to start hacking the JavaScript code. For instance, you may want to use a different charting library, remove the y or x axis from the current chart, use a different projection, alter the map size or color scheme. The log messages panel in QGIS will contain the topojson command used to convert the shapefile to topojson, and can be used as a template to hand craft your own conversions. NOTE: Pre-requisite of Node.js and the topojson package.
